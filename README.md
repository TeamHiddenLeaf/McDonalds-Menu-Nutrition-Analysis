# McDonalds-Menu-Nutrition-Analysis

## Data Engineering Mini Group Project (The University of Chicago, Physical Sciences Division)

## Tools Used - Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- This dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.

## Project Instructions

- How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value? What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs? What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?
